    printf("The height of the triangle is =");
    scanf("%f",&h);
    printf("The base of the triangle is =");
    scanf("%f",&b);
    A=0.5*(h*b);
    printf("The area of the triangle is : %.2f\n",A);
    return 0; 
}


The height of the triangle is =11.2
The base of the triangle is =5.6
The area of the triangle is : 31.36
